# Dactylic CW Keyer

This is a fork of https://github.com/donfroula/ATTiny85_CW_Keye

This keyer implements the Dactylic mode for single paddle keys. In this
mode, dahs are sent when the paddle is moved, dits when the paddle is
kept. This reduces the number of movements compared to a traditional
single paddle keyer, see keyer.pdf for details.
